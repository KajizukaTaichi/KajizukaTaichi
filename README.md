## Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm Kajizuka Taichi.<br>
It called me genius programmer.

My most confidence project is "Stack" that my own stack-oriented script language.<br>
That advantage is powerful meta-programming features.<br>
Please use it if you have interest!

I love low layer technology such as developing own programming language.<br>
Web developing is also I love it because design UI/UX will be joy.

But, I'm bad at persevering because I'm tomboy who do thing I want only.<br>
Take for example, progress of writing documentation of Stack is slowly pace because it's boring for me.<br>
However, I think my passion bet programming is greater than anyone.<br>

And, my mottoes are 2 quote "Stay hungry, stay foolish!" and "Human is a thinking reed".<br>
First one expresses I prefer challenge, second one is my love for research.<br>

My futures dream is to start up venture and make a innovation.<br>
I'm studying hard to grant its dream.

Nice to meet you!
